PROCEDURE FOR: Personal Vehicles Used for Company Business
If specifically requested by Johnstone Supply of CNY (hereafter referred to as "The Company"),
Employees using personal vehicles on company business will be reimbursed as follows:
Unless otherwise specified by individual agreement, all mileage is reimbursed by submitting
travel claims logging onto The Company's online expense claim submission website. The
prevailing rate paid for mileage reimbursement is indicated on the site.
An employee's commute to and from work is not considered to be the conduct of Company
business.
The Company carries liability insurance to cover third party claims from accidents in Employee
owned personal vehicles used for Company business. However, this insurance is excess over
the employee's own personal automobile insurance and does not protect the Employee for
either liability (third party) claims or physical damage to Employee's own vehicle.
Employees must have a valid, current driver's license and agree to authorize the review of their
Motor Vehicle Record by Kibble & Prentice, agent of record for The Company, and its insurance
company or broker as often as required. Driving record must meet the standards as specified in
the Motor Vehicle Safety Policy. Proof of personal auto liability limits of at least $300,000 must
