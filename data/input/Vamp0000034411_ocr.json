It was impressive that you sent your Driver immediately with the damaged equipment, to get us a replacement. It is rare that any Vendor is able to\nmake that happen in normal times, let alone the crazy supply environment we find ourselves in today. Your dedication to Client satisfaction and service has certainly been proven.\nIn addition, the Driver for your Branch was pleasant, professional and courteous throughout the entire exchange. Again, not something that we are accustomed to in today's climate. He certainly deserves some praise in this\nas well.\nHats off to you and your Team for an excellent experience in the face of a challenge. If I had a Wallace email address, I would have copied them as well. Lynda should forward this to one of them.\nHave a good week and thank you again.\nThank you,\nMatthew Cardwell\nParts Manager\nFidelity Mechanical Services",
