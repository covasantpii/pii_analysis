A personal registration code expires once\nused or on the expiration date (whichever is earlier) and can be reissued if it is lost or compromised. To protect your employee's account from fraud due to identity theft, personal registration codes will be issued ONLY to\nemployees with unique email addresses.\nOnce issued, employees receive their personal registration code in an email from ADP (SecurityServices_NoReply@adp.com) and use it during registration to create their ADP service account.
