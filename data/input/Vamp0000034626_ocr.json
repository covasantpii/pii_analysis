I don't think you copied me on the email\nwhen you sent the MERP. I'm not sure how I'm going to find out if you are on vacation. I know you messaged me that it was\ndone. In the future, I think we should be copying each other on the emails. Thanks.\nThe MERP has been processed that's the only thing I've heard back from them so far. Will do though.\nER\nElanie Rodriguez 8/10 8:50 AM\nYesterday\nER\nElanie Rodriguez Yesterday 5:03 PM\nI got two emails with one rejected and one approved time card. Which one was the last submission for you?\nFrom*\nER\nYesterday 5:35 PM\nThe original timesheet had 24.20 hours with a .30 lunch. I assumed the lunch should be .50 and the total 24 hours so I\ncorrected it. What is correct?\nElanie Rodriguez Yesterday 8:11 PM\nYeah I didn't take a lunch break Wednesday only my two 15 mins breaks that's why it said .30 But it's okay just leave it like\nthat.\nToday\n80\nF\nI'm confused because you drove to the office during your lunch and you can't be paid for that time. That's why I corrected the\ntimesheet.\n6:16 AM",
