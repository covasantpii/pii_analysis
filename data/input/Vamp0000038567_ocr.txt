Work restrictions according to the U.S. Department of Labor:
Sedentary Work. Sedentary Work involves exerting up to 10 pounds of force occasionally or a
negligible amount of force frequently to lift, carry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects, including the
human body. Sedentary work involves sitting most of the time but may involve walking or standing for
brief periods of time. Jobs may be defined as Sedentary when walking and standing are required only
occasionally, and all other Sedentary criteria are met.
☐ Light Work. Light Work involves exerting up to 20 pounds of force occasionally or up to 10 pounds of
force frequently, or a negligible amount of force constantly to move objects. Physical demand
requirements are in excess of those for Sedentary Work. Even though the weight lifted may be only a
negligible amount, a job/occupation is rated Light Work when it requires: (1) walking or standing to a
significant degree; (2) sitting most of the time while pushing or pulling arm or leg controls; or (3)
working at a production rate pace while constantly pushing or pulling materials even though the weight
of the materials is negligible. (The constant stress and strain of maintaining a production rate pace,
especially in an industrial setting, can be and is physically demanding of a worker even though the
amount of force exerted is negligible.)
Medium Work. Medium Work involves exerting 20 to 50 pounds of force occasionally or 10 to 25
pounds of force frequently or an amount greater than negligible and up to 10 pounds constantly to
move objects. Physical demand requirements are in excess of these for Light Work.
Heavy Work. Heavy Work involves exerting 50 to 100 pounds of force occasionally, or 25 to 50
pounds of force frequently, or 10 to 20 pounds of force constantly to move objects. Physical demand
requirements are in excess of those for Medium Work.
Very Heavy Work. Very Heavy work involves exerting in excess of 100 pounds of force occasionally,
or in excess of 50 pounds of force frequently or in excess of 20 pounds of force constantly to move
objects, Physical demand requirements are in excess of those for Heavy Work.
