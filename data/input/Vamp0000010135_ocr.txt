Claim Details
A claim for services you received was sent to MVP. This EOB can help you understand the amount charged by your
health care provider and what your health plan paid. It also shows the out-of-pocket costs that you must pay.
If you received covered services from an MVP-participating provider, that provider has agreed to accept the Allowed
Amount shown below as payment in full, minus any Deductible, Copay or Coinsurance.
If services were from a provider not participating with MVP, you may need to pay the difference between the Billed
Charges shown below and the Allowed Amount.
