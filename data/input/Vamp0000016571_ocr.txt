In consideration of each BANK's compliance with this authorization, CLIENT agrees that such BANK's treatment of any charge, and such BANK's rights with
respect thereto, shall be the same as if the charge were initiated personally by CLIENT, and that if any charge is dishonored, whether with or without cause,
such BANK shall be under no liability whatsoever. In addition, CLIENT authorizes ADP to credit the applicable DDA ACCOUNT when necessary, at ADP's
sole discretion, for any refund or credit amount due CLIENT.
In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any other agreement, this Agreement shall
control with respect to any money transmission services, including Payment Services. CLIENT acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, CLIENT'S right to refund under any State law shall first be subject to any offset for funds due to ADP with respect to any previous transactions
completed on CLIENT'S behalf by ADP, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other agreement between CLIENT and ADP.
This authorization shall remain in effect unless and until revoked in writing by an authorized representative of CLIENT and until the applicable BANK(s) and
ADP have each received such notice and have had reasonable time to act upon such notice.
