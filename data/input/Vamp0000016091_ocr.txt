Personal registration codes are alphanumeric codes randomly generated by ADP and distributed to users by email or shared by your administrator (verbally or on paper) for registration. A personal registration code expires once
used or on the expiration date (whichever is earlier) and can be reissued if it is lost or compromised. To protect your employee's account from fraud due to identity theft, personal registration codes will be issued ONLY to
employees with unique email addresses.
Once issued, employees receive their personal registration code in an email from ADP (SecurityServices_NoReply@adp.com) and use it during registration to create their ADP service account. Click on the email address field to
update the unique email addresses of the employees.
